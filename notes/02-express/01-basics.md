#EXPRESS
Express is a minimalist, unopinionated web framework that acts as a robust routing and middleware layer on top of the native Node.js http module.
It is designed to handle the plumbing of a web server so you can focus on business logic

Unlike frameworks like NestJS or Django, it doesn't force you to use a specific folder structure, database, or template engine. You decide how to architect your app.

Native Node.js vs. Express
In native Node, parsing a URL, handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST), and sending JSON requires a lot of "boilerplate" code. Express abstracts this into simple methods like app.get() and res.json().
